# Advent Of Code HARDMODE

These are my solutions for Advent of Code in PHP and Java but only with streams (as long as possible).

I will push solutions with one day delay and only if I was able to do them of course.

To submit I use my hacked solution of PHP. Afterwards I do Java streams. And yes it is faster to hack PHP than doing Java streams.

And now: Happy `$suffering`!
